## What is it ?
A simple tic tac toe game, yet instead of "O" and "X" it's Blue vs Red.
Two player game alternating between red and blue.

## How it works.

* compares red and blue classes, within the css.
* removes played classes on click of new game button.
* sets game board to original board.
* hide() and fadeIn() functions used to make board fade back in.

* sweet alert plugin used to differ alert boxes from original alerts.
